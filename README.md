# ch_pause_yt_ext
A browser extension that pauses a YouTube video upon the end of a chapter within that video
Gap learning is a technique of taking frequent seemingly inncocuous short breaks, during study/work sessions
These breaks are said to trigger the response of our brains analyzing and processing any information someone was just engaged in
I think a tool that pauses YT videos after each chapter, during an educational video can help promote this learning method
